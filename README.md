# Youtube Video:
Due to unforseen technical difficulties with my PC and running the emulator, no YouTube video was created.
I could not find a way to fix it.
# Purpose:
This application was designed to help history students with studying for a test by making use of app generated history true or false questions. This helps the learner to memorise the dates and the events that took place then.
# Design:
I wanted to create a class room like aesthetic for the app, so I turned the backgrounds of the question screen and the score + review screen to that same shade of green the big boards in front of a class room. The font I used also gives the feeling of chalk written instructions. To make the app seem appealing, I tinted the buttons a little lighter to fit the screen backgrounds as well as to not confuse the user on where the buttons are.
# Github Actions:
I did not use it simply because I do not know how.
The links provided only confused me more.
